# hangman_game
Made a hangman game from which a user can input any word and it can be used to play hangman

The way this is played is that one user can enter in any word of their choosing and the other player has 6 incorrect guesses before hangman game is complete. User can only enter 1 letter at a time, and cannot repeat letters which have previously been said.
